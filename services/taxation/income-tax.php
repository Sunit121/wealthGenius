                <p>(2). This age-related allowance is reduced by £1 for every £2 of income above this limit.</p>

A spouse or civil partner who is not liable to income tax; or not liable at the higher or additional rate, can transfer this amount of their personal allowance to their spouse or civil partner. The recipient must not be liable to income tax at the higher or additional rate. The recipient is eligible to a tax reduction of 20% of the transferred amount up to a maximum of £252.</p>
                <p>(6). Individuals will not have to pay tax on the first £500 of dividend income they receive.</p>
                <p>(7). Basic rate taxpayers will not have to pay tax on the first £1,000 of savings income they receive, and higher rate taxpayers will not have tax to pay on their first £500 of savings income. </p>

                <p>The self-employed can claim business expenses against their income. So, make sure you include all possible justifiable business expenses on your self-assessment form. This also applies to capital allowances for expenditure on plant and equipment, including computers and tools, for example, used for your business. </p>
                <p>It is worth remembering you may be able to pay further contributions to your pension, which can utilise unused tax relief. </p>
                <p>Since its introduction in 1990, Gift Aid allows taxpayers to receive tax relief on gifts made to qualifying charities.</p>
                <p>One other point to remember is if one spouse is a taxpayer and the other is not or pays tax at a lower rate it is worth considering switching certain investments to take advantage of their unused tax allowances.</p>
